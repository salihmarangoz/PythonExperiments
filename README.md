# PythonExperiments
Various small Python codes from Deep Learning to Robotics. Check my [blog](https://salihmarangoz.github.io/) for more.

| Experiment | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| [CrackDetectionYOLOv8](CrackDetectionYOLOv8/README.md) | Crack Detection using YOLOv8. |
| [OptunaIK](OptunaIK/README.md) | Can I solve inverse kinematics using Optuna? Well... There are many good solutions to this problem. It is possible to solve using Optuna. It is not a good solution. But a solution... |
| [FastSAM_webcam](FastSAM_webcam/README.md) | Playing with Fast Segment Anything Model using a webcam. |
| [Backscrub_Alt](Backscrub_Alt/README.md) | I was trying to find an alternative to [floe/backscrub](https://github.com/floe/backscrub) and tried models from [anilsathyan7/Portrait-Segmentation](anilsathyan7/Portrait-Segmentation). Also, `portrait_video.py` writes the output image to stdout in binary which is forwarded to v4l2loopback device using ffmpeg. |
| [BatteryUsageApp](BatteryUsageApp/README.md) | System tray app which shows battery power usage in laptops. |
| [OscilloscopeVisualizer](OscilloscopeVisualizer/README.md) | Generating sound via processing the webcam image and visualizing it like oscilloscopes would do. |
| [TeaOptuna](TeaOptuna/README.md) | My journey to find the best way for brewing tea using a hyper-parameter tuning library - Optuna -. Still implementing. I just need to continue brewing tea instead of making coffee to develop this further. |
| [Backscrub_Alt_2](Backscrub_Alt_2/README.md) | I was trying to find an alternative to [floe/backscrub](https://github.com/floe/backscrub). I tried to use optical flow to combine it with the exponential weighted averaging. There are also other experiments with grabcut and bilateral filtering. |
